### Custom IRL Rig

Taking cues from the GunRun Backpack, we're building a more afforable IRL rig with a better pricepoint, more functionality, better documented, and with a lower barrier of entry so more people can get out there and share their experiences with the world!ANCHOR 

#### Status

Currently field-testing. Live streams/tests occuring multiple times a week atm while we test improvements. Documentation to begin soon.
